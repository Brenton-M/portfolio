            communication app for the C-era Medical Clinic to resolve
            communication issues between patients and physicians. The app was

            receptionist.

            As part of a patient care initiative at the C-era Medical Clinic, I
            alongside my partner analyzed satisfaction surveys to over 600

            the clinic from the patient&#39;s perspective and to uncover areas
            for improvement. This would eventually lead to us developing a
